# BallRunner

This game was created in cooperation with my buddy Jumu, shoutouts ye !
It was an assignment during our '3D-Engine-Technology' course.
Feel free to look into this masterpiece of software history.

In total, you can play three levels with increasing difficulty.
We also included a procedural level generator for endless hours of fun.
And the last hidden gem is a test level which we used while developing our game.

Theoretically it would be possible to create a executable of this game.
But you can play it also in the Unity Editor if you follow the ssteps below. 

## How to start the game ?

- Install Unity-Hub
